# Daily_Demand_Forecast
Project: 
Time-Series Forecasting for Brazilian Logistics

Description:
In this project, I worked with a time-series dataset from a prominent logistics company in Brazil. The dataset spanned a 60-day operational period and encompassed various attributes influencing daily order volumes. The objective was to develop an accurate predictive model for forecasting the total daily orders requiring treatment by the company.

Dataset Characteristics:
The dataset is an ".arff" header for Weka; Attribute-Relation File Format, commonly used for representing tabular data along with attribute information, suitable for machine learning tasks.

Predictive Attributes: 
The dataset contains twelve predictive attributes. These attributes represent:
@relation Daily_Demand_Forecasting_Orders
@attribute Week_of_the_month {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0}
@attribute Day_of_the_week_(Monday_to_Friday) {2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0}
@attribute Non_urgent_order integer
@attribute Urgent_order integer
@attribute Order_type_A integer
@attribute Order_type_B integer
@attribute Order_type_C integer
@attribute Fiscal_sector_orders integer
@attribute Orders_from_the_traffic_controller_sector integer
@attribute Banking_orders_(1) integer
@attribute Banking_orders_(2) integer
@attribute Banking_orders_(3) integer
@attribute Target_(Total_orders) integer
@data. 

Approach:
I meticulously preprocessed the dataset, handling missing values and ensuring data readiness. Leveraging pandas and Python, I explored the data to understand its characteristics. The dataset included information such as week of the month, day of the week, and different order types. To capture temporal patterns, I applied advanced time-series analysis techniques.

Outcomes:
By employing mathematical insights, I uncovered patterns, trends, and potential cyclic behaviors within the data. The core achievement was the development of a predictive model capable of forecasting daily order volumes. The model incorporated insights from various attributes, enabling the logistics company to make informed decisions regarding resource allocation, workforce management, and inventory control.

Use Case and Importance:
Accurate predictions of daily order totals can be highly valuable for the logistics company. This information can aid in resource allocation, workforce planning, inventory management, and overall operational efficiency. For example, by knowing in advance when there might be a surge in orders, the company can ensure they have enough staff and resources available to meet customer demands.
Academic Context: The dataset has been utilized in academic research at the Universidade Nove de Julho, that is, it has academic relevance.

Impact:
This project exemplifies my proficiency in handling real-world datasets and employing advanced analytical techniques. The predictive model I developed empowers the logistics company to optimize operational efficiency by anticipating order volumes accurately. The project not only highlights my technical skills but also showcases my ability to communicate complex findings effectively to diverse stakeholders.

Tools Used:
Python, Pandas, Time-Series Analysis, Data Preprocessing, Predictive Modeling.
